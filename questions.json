In the later period, settlements expanded eastward into the Ganga-Yamuna plains, agriculture intensified, iron was used, and political authority became more centralized with larger kingdoms emerging. Social stratification hardened into the varna system, rituals became elaborate, and philosophical inquiry began, paving the way for the Upanishadic tradition. The Vedic Age thus laid the cultural, social, and religious foundations of Indian civilization.",

        "The Sangam age refers to that period in the early history of south India when large numbers of poems in Tamil were composed by a number of authors.

However, their position was miserable as they were prohibited to decorate themselves or participate in any form of amusement. Hence statement 1 is not correct.",
