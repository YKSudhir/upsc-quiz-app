        "Asvaghosa (1st–2nd century CE) was a Buddhist philosopher-poet who wrote Buddhacharita, a Sanskrit mahākāvya narrating the life of the Buddha. Hence, pair 1 is correctly matched.",
        "Milindapañho (Questions of King Milinda) is attributed to Nāgasena, not Vasumitra. Vasumitra (2nd century CE, Kushana period) presided over the Fourth Buddhist Council and is credited with Samayabhedoparacanacakra, a work on Buddhist sects. Hence, pair 2 is not correctly matched.",
        "Bilhaṇa, a Kashmiri poet (11th century CE), authored the drama Devichandraguptam. The play narrates an episode from the early Gupta period involving Ramagupta, Chandragupta II, and Queen Dhruvadevi. Hence, pair 3 is correctly matched."

      "explanation": [
        "The Suhrawardi order, initially founded in Baghdad, gradually expanded its influence across multiple regions of the Islamic world, most notably in Persia (Iran) and the Indian subcontinent.",
        "The Suhrawardi order is an orthodox Sunni Sufi order, founded in 12th-century Baghdad by Abu al-Najib al-Suhrawardi, a Persian Sufi who died in 1168 CE. The Suharwardi order entered India at about the same time as the Chishtis. The most well-known saints of the order were Shaikh Shihabuddin Suharwardi and Hamid-ud-Din Nagori. Hence, statement 1 is correct.",
        "Unlike the Chishtis, the Suharwardi saints did not believe in leading a life of poverty. They accepted the service of the state, and some of them held important posts in the ecclesiastical department. The Chishtis, on the other hand, preferred to keep aloof from state politics and shunned the company of rulers and nobles. However, the order helped the rulers in their own way by creating a climate of opinion in which people belonging to different sects and religions could live in peace and harmony. Hence, statements 2 and 3 are not correct."

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": [
        "The Vedic Age (c. 1500–600 BCE) marks the period when the Indo-Aryans composed the Vedas, the earliest literary sources of Indian history. It is generally divided into the Early Vedic Period (Rigvedic, c. 1500–1000 BCE) and the Later Vedic Period (c. 1000–600 BCE).",
        "The early phase, centered in the Punjab and north-west, reflects a semi-nomadic, pastoral society with cattle as the main wealth and simple tribal political structures led by chiefs (rajan). In the later period, settlements expanded eastward into the Ganga-Yamuna plains, agriculture intensified, iron was used, and political authority became more centralized with larger kingdoms emerging. Social stratification hardened into the varna system, rituals became elaborate, and philosophical inquiry began, paving the way for the Upanishadic tradition. The Vedic Age thus laid the cultural, social, and religious foundations of Indian civilization.",
        "\"Purcharishnu\" refers to a destructive machine, a type of mobile fort, used by the Aryans during the Vedic Age to aid in their expansion and in warfare. It was one of the technological advancements, alongside horse-drawn chariots, bronze and iron weapons, and armor, that contributed to their military success. Hence, pair 1 is correctly matched.",
        "Goshu : Derived from go (cow). Since cows were the primary unit of wealth, goshu implies wealth, possessions. Whereas, Gaviṣṭi means battle/conflict, especially cattle raid or search for cows, in the Rigvedic context. Hence, pair 2 is not correctly matched.",
        "Langala : The plough, symbol of settled agriculture, marks the transition from pastoralism to agriculture in the later Vedic period. Hence, pair 3 is correctly matched."
